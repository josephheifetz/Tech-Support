<a href="#"><b>About Me</b></a> 
<p>Hi my name is Omar Adnan. I'm currently a student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology(RMIT) and am currently doing a Bachelors in Information Technology. I was born in Pakistan but migrated to Australia 10 years ago. Coming from an Urdu speaking background, I was quickly able to learn the Arabic language and then English coming to Australia.</p>
<p>My main hobbies are mainly based around Sports. I see myself as a very Sporty and competitive person regarding any matter. Ideally I look at myself as a decent cricketer but yet still am able to perform well in Soccer and Aussie Rules. </p>
<p>I also consider myself as someone who is easily bored from a certain activity, therefore I'm always looking for new activities which can diminish my boredom.</p>
<br>
<a href="#"><b>Interest in I.T.</b></a>
<p> Since Information Technology is a very vast field, there are many aspects that can be considered as a future profession or goal. For my case, I'm equally confused with two categories including Data Base Security and Games Developing. My interest in IT was from a very young age. Family and those around always considered me as a future IT technician of some sort. Therefore, my lust for this field started to grow as I sensed this was the right field for me, so did the others around me. After speaking to many graduates and hearing all sorts of respectable praises, I figured that RMIT was the intituition for me. From the very start of receiving my Universities preferance list to graduating from Year 12. I searched hard, but was unable to find a more suitable learning station for me.
From RMIT, I have high expectations of developing a profound knowledge in the field of Information Technology.  
</p>
<a href="#"><b>Ideal Job</b></a>
<p>The I.T. World is huge, therefore there are many categories and fields with this huge field that can be seen as a possible future job. But, in my case the category of Game Development is at the top of the hierarchy. Especially, if there is a job related with Virtual Reality. </p>
<p> An Ideal Job for me: https://www.seek.com.au/job/35815461?type=standard&userqueryid=6b0908db39e060519d57837eb2226f99-6515718 </p>

<tt>reference from Seek</tt>
<p>This job is ideal for me as it revolves around the future of technology and that it is within the bounds of what I want my profession to be. Initially, it is understable that for such a high profile job, certain skills will be required. Skills such as experience in coding, a good command on one of the languages including Java, C++ and obviously an interest in the Virtual Reality field. Out of which I consider myself of being someone who shows alot of interest in the field and is pretty decent with coding.</p>
<p>Despite being confident in many aspects of this field, I will still require further command on languages and will need to be a lot more familiar with any future updates. To obtain these skills, it will be essential that my Bachelors Degree is utilised properly.</p>   
<a href="#"><b>Personal Profile</b></a>
<p><strong>Myers-Briggs Test</strong></p>
<p> Extraversion + Sensing + Feeling + Judging </p>
<p>Actively sociable. Warm. Harmonizer. Caring. Enthusiastic. Empathic. People-oriented. Practical. Responsible. Concrete. Orderly. Conscientious. Co-operative. Appreciative. Loyal.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Styles Test</strong><p>
<p>Auditory: 35%
Visual: 20%
Tactile: 45%
</p>
<p><strong>Tactile</strong></p>
<p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. 
As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.
</p>
<p><strong>Big Five Personality Test</strong></p>
<p>OCEAN</p>
<p>Open-mindedness + Conscientiousness + Extraversion + Agreeableness + Negative Emotionality</p>
<p>The result from each test identifies my personality in different aspects. These results do portray the significance of my work ethics in a team and through I can confirm that I'm not very good with teams but in a field such as I.T., I have no other choice.</p>
<a href="#"><b>Project Ideas</b></a>
<p><strong>Overview</strong><p>
<p>Since the very start of my interest in the field of Information Technology, I have always been very passionate about developing games. Which comes to my project idea of developing a ‘Virtual Reality game of Cricket’. This project will consist of using the recently released “Virtual Reality” technology and will redecorate the fundamentals of a very underrated game in the sense of virtual gaming. From a very young age I have been very fond of this sport and since then have been wanting to promote this sport all over the world. Now that the world is fast developing and that people’s opinions and ideas are of importance, this project can make a significant impact!</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>My motivation for this project came from experiencing the ‘Virtual Reality’ technology first hand. I figured that this technology is “the future” in various categories including gaming. The gaming world was unable to develop any game that required the user to have physical involvement with their whole body, especially their eyes. Until now, where the user is required to interact with the game in the sense that they are in the game. Which of course brings out their true emotions and reactions. Apart from the technology side of my project, I figured that I would need to find an activity where I will be able to get a decent amount of user activity. Therefore, I chose my category of Sport and in the field of Cricket.</p> 
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The sport of Cricket is underestimated in the ‘fun’ sense of a physical activity. Being a sport that has been around since the 16th Century, I figured that it was about time there was some sort of justice served for the undervalued sport. Also, seeing that the “Virtual Reality” technology was an insight to the future, especially in the sense of gaming. I was immediately grasped by it and decided to develop an idea of a game of Cricket involving the technology. The game will be named “VR Cricket” and will coincidentally allow the user to experience the fundamentals of the sport through the eyes of real cricketers and what they experience on the field. The game will require a lot of time as it will be developed on a fairly new device and with very intense features. To allow the user to have the best experience, they game will be conducted in a way where the user can adjust the settings and difficulty to their skill. This game is also being developed in the sense of potentially becoming useful to professional    Cricketing teams to help the professional sportsmen improve their skill in various aspects. The game will rely a lot on user interactions as if the user is not moving simultaneously the player in game wont move and vice versa for when the user is moving.</p>  
<p><strong>Tools and Technology</strong></p> 
<p>The game will be developed through Unreal Engine as it is the most efficient and easy to use software for such projects. Once the game is developed, the User will be required to purchase the Virtual Reality headset for visionary fundamentals and a VR controller for in-game features. As the game is sports categorized, it doesn’t necessarily require the need of sound, therefore headphones are not fully recommended. The use of Maya and ZBrush will b essential as these softwares will determine the overall presentation of the game.</p>   
<p><strong>Skills Required</strong></p>
<p>For this project, skills involving the use of Java or C# for coding, the use of the software “tracking” for head and body movements, Graphic Design, Animation, Audio Design, User Studies, Psychology to understand the emotions of users, method of “Stitching” for a 360 degree image, Adobe’s video editing software, basics of colour correction and the concept of Drones for capturing unique angles and video footage for virtual reality are all vital for this project to be successful in development.</p> 
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p>If this project is to be successful, I believe that will be a big step for the Cricketing and Virtual Reality communities. From this game users from around the globe will be able to connect and share their experience of a game involving an underrated sport and the use of futuristic technology. This will also be a major morale boost for me and through it I will be able to plan future projects involving similar technology but with a different gaming logic.</p>
