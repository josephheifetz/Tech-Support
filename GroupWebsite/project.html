          <h1 class="page-title">Overview</h1>
            
            <p>My project idea is related to sports and accurate decision making by robots using artificial intelligence. “Robot umpires” can replace humans in sports such as cricket and soccer, where they can identify a situation and make precise and informed decisions in quick successions. Having a hardware robot situated at the place where umpires stand with a quality software with the basic rules and knowledge of the sport and sensory information to identify the surroundings. Example: a bowler stepping over the line and bowling a no-ball in cricket. The robot should be able to see and identify that the bowler has stepped over the line and produce an output accordingly.</p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">Motivation</h1>
            <p>“Robot umpires” can be useful because it provides precise and correct decisions in quick time which humans are unable to do. This will result in a fair game/match and will provide entertainment for the spectators.  More than 30% of decisions given in a cricket match by human umpires are false all around the world, and in some cases, the umpires are biased towards one team. This results in unfairness and is deemed against the spirit of the game, but artificial intelligent robot umpires are the assembled solution to this problem. These robots can revolutionise the sporting industry by giving a much more effective and efficient gaming experience for both the players and the spectators. </p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">Description</h1>
            <p>(Taking cricket as the sporting example here) The robot must provide accurate decisions and produce an instant output for players and spectators understanding. Such as signalling four, six, or out in cricket. Their ability to identify the situation and give decision immediately will be the key to making the sporting event highly effective and efficient. It will produce precise detail of the surrounding that a human umpire can’t provide accurately. Such as; the pace of each delivery being bowled, if it was a legal delivery or not. It will have a human-like body with the ability to see the surrounding and capture it in a video form. The surrounding and each delivery being bowled and faced will be the input, it will process the information that was received to ensure if it was a legal delivery and if the batsman wasn’t out or the batsman made any runs of that bowl. This information will be sent on to the big screen and will be outputted by the robot accordingly for everyone related to that event. Example; players, spectators at the venue or people watching at home. Although minimal user interface will be used in this product; there will be a person to set the dimensions of the ground and the format of the game (20 or 50 overs) will be configured before each match commences. It won’t consume the same space as a human umpire does and it will have aesthetically pleasing hardware to make it appear pleasant to the viewers watching the match. It will be programmed to have a deep understanding of the match and its surroundings; a decision review system (DRS) will be implemented in the program too, to reduce the time spent on checking for the correct decision. The only restrain it has is that it can not handle disputes between two players on the field while the match is going. The robot can't communicate, neither it can physically stop players from fighting. Also, it is at the risk of getting hit by a cricket ball on the field as its unable to move around the area when a ball is coming towards it at high speed. This can damage the product and can be significantly expensive to repair or build another system. </p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">Tools and Technologies </h1>
            <p>To build a “robot umpire” having a strong software is crucial to be able to carry out tasks more efficiently and effectively than humans. I am unsure as to what exact software is needed to build an artificially intelligent system as powerful as this because I don’t have enough experience in creating robots yet. Hardware needs to be sturdy and aesthetically pleasing. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a moveable object. Thus, the main focus is on building a strong software and programming the system to produce correct output quickly.
                
            <h1 class="page-title">Skills Required </h1>
            <p>The skills required for this project will be high levels of programming in a specific language to be able to run a system like that. These skills can be learnt in an IT or computer since university degree, but these skills will probably develop over experience in building such systems. Experience team members in programming and build hardware are required to build this project successfully. The skills and software will be developed from scratch, but the hardware will be readily made and will be bought from a third party. Lastly, the hardware will be put together by experienced team members in hardware engineering and with the finishing touches, the product will be ready to implement in a real life international match.</p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">Outcome</h1>
            <p>If the project is successful it will revolutionise the sporting industry. “Robot umpires” can provide precise and correct decisions in quick time which humans are unable to do. Because of its accurate decision-making program in a quick time, the matches will be played out fairly and effectively. This will solve the issue of biased and incorrect decision given by umpires towards one team. This project can be built for other sports and can be implemented in them too. Thus, resulting in fair sports and more entertainment for not only the players but fans as well.</p>
