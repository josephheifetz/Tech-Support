			<h2><a name= "p2"></a>Interest in IT</h2>
			<ul>
					<p style="font-weight:bold">What is your interest in IT?</p>
<p>My interest in IT is app and website development because they can be useful to most 
of the society. In this era everything is connected to the internet hence applications 
and websites are essential for users and big companies who rely on ecommerce businesses. 
Apps also interest me because there are many different types of apps which are used for 
different purposes such as music, games, socialisation and many more. However, 
there are still many more apps which are yet to be created for various user needs.</p> 

<p style="font-weight:bold">When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</p>
<p>My interest in IT started at the age of 14 when my brother in law introduced me to IT. 
My brother in Law is a senior functional analyst at Griffith University and his job is 
to test the websites therefore he taught me how to write basic code and that was what 
intrigued me. I then started making simple website which I enjoyed hence it became a hobby of mine.</p>   

<p style="font-weight:bold">Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>

<p> Currently I do not have actual job experience in IT however I have gained 
experience in IT while doing a few DIY projects such as upgrading my laptop. 
I upgraded my laptop by replacing the HHD with a SSD while doing this I gained knowledge 
about the computer hardware. I also gained some experience while I was making a website in the 
past for a friend. While creating the website I gained knowledge in writing html and using java script.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT because it is based in Melbourne and it is a well 
renowned University for technology. RMIT University also has an exceptional 
reputation and it has world class lectures and tutors. I wanted to study Information technology 
and RMIT offered me a space for Bachelor of Information Technology. 
Therefore I accepted the offer because RMIT I believe is very good for studying IT.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
<p>I expect to learn the skills and knowledge needed to work in the IT field. 
Skills such as programming, people skill (public speaking) and presentation skills. 
The knowledge I expect to learn will be about computer systems and how computers operate. 
I also expect to learn how to create website and write software using different coding languages. 
Hence I expect to learn how to develop softwares and applications.

			<div id="image2"><img src="./img1/table.png" width="780" height= "300"></div>
			<ul>
					<p style="font-weight:bold">What do these test results mean for me:</p>
<p>For the MBTI test the results mean that I am extraverted which means that I prefer group activities and I like social 
interaction also I am more enthusiastic. The results also suggest that I am observant therefore it means I am more practical, 
pragmatic and down-to-earth, I also inherit strong habits. ‘Feeling’ means that I am emotionally expressive and sensitive therefore 
the feeling type prefer social harmony and cooperation. The judging type means for me that I am decisive and very organised. 
The assertive type for me means that I don’t take a lot of stress and I do not get angry however it also means that I lack motivation 
to fulfil my goals. In the learning style test it means that I learn better with audio rather than visual or tactile. Lastly with the 
colour code personality test it means that I seek for intimacy and they enjoy interacting with others.  </p>
					<p style="font-weight:bold">How do these results influence my behaviour in a team:</p>
<p>These results may influence my behaviour in a team because according to the test I am decisive and not motivated to fulfil my goals.
 According to the results I am overly enthusiastic, and I like social interaction. Therefore, in a team I will contribute and positively 
interact with the team members. According to the results I also seek social harmony and cooperation hence I will cooperate will the team 
to accomplish the tasks. Also I am not prone to argument hence therefore will be social harmony. </p>
					<p style="font-weight:bold">How should I take this into account when forming a team:</p>
<p>When forming a team, I will need to seek individual who will motivate me to do better and succeed with my goals. 
I should also choose individuals who are cooperative and even-tempered. However, because I am decisive I should choose to work 
with individuals who are indecisive hence we can get along easily.   I should also only choose individual who are positive because 
I like interacting with other who are also positive.</p>

			<h2><a name= "p5"></a>Project Ideas</h2>
			<ul>
	
<p style="font-weight:bold">Overview</p>
<p>This project is about developing a smart phone application which can compensate for a 
doctor/GP for minor health problems for example a cold or cough. The application will be 
created for android and iOS devices and the target audience for this application is everyone 
within the ages of 18-65. The application will be simple to use and useful to majority of users. 
This app is useful because it will be able to suggest remedies to users when they enter their symptoms. 
This project of creating this app will require to write software which is able to answer the user’s quires.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Motivation</p>
<p>The application aims to eliminate the need of going to the doctor for minor health problems or when 
the doctors are closed. This application will act as a virtual doctor. This will be useful because 70% of 
patients who go to the doctors are usually prescribed medication which is also available without a prescription
 hence it is available at the chemist over the counter. Therefore, the only reason they go to the doctors is to 
find out which medication to take. This application aims to teach users about their symptoms and it tells them to which medication to take.  </p>


<p style="font-weight:bold">Description</p>
<p>The main feature on this application will be a search bar where the users 
can search up the causes or treatments for their symptoms. Firstly, the user 
will enter their details such as their age, weight, allergies and if they have 
any medical history which effects their health today for example if they have diabetes 
or if they have had a cardiac arrest before, excreta.  The users detail will also be 
anonymous however it will be taken under consideration while suggesting the cause or treatment for the user’s symptoms.</p>

<p>Once the user enters their details the app will tell the user to enter their 
symptoms for example if they have a headache or a cold. Then it will ask how much 
pain they are experiencing from a scale of 1 to 10 and if the user answer it being 
on the low end of the scale (0-3) the app will suggest medications which they will 
be able to buy at the chemist without a prescription. However, if the user is experiencing 
major pain for example 7 -10 on the scale the app will suggest calling an ambulance. In some 
situations, the app may also suggest that CPR should be performed on the user if they are 
finding it difficult to breath while the ambulance is on the way.  If the user is experiencing 
medium pain for example 4-6 on the scale the app will suggest the user to see a doctor/GP.</p>

<p>All the responses given by the app to the users will be set 
under the guidance of real and reputed doctors. Therefore, this app will be safe to use, 
and all the treatments advised by the app will be set using the recommendations of certified doctors. 
The app will only give personalised responses to users for example different users have different health 
conditions like diabetes therefore the responses given by the app will vary as the situations change. 
This is because some medications are not suitable for different patients. The app will also advise the 
user the possibilities for what is causing the problem which will help the users to prevent these issues 
to occur again or at least take precautions.  Hence this app will also teach the users about the medical problem they are experiencing. </p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Tools and technology </p>

<p>To make this application work we will need technology such as a software developer and servers. 
The tools needed for making this application will be a laptop. Technologies which are used to run mobile application such as online servers and call centres. The call
centers will be used if the users are having any difficulty while using the application. </p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Skill required</p>
<p>The main skill which will be required to do this project is application software writing skills. 
Other skills needed will be design skills because this application must be designed according to the users (User Centred Design).  
Also skills such as developing the user interface and interaction. Knowledge about medications and symptoms will need to be known.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Outcome </p>
<p>If this project is successful, the world will be different because users will know how to prevent 
their illnesses as they will know what is causing them.  The original problem was having to go to the 
doctors for minor problems and this application will solve this problem by tell the user what is wrong 
with them via the application. The impact this development will have is that the users will save time on having to go to the doctor.  This   </p>
