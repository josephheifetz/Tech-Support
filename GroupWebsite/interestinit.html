          <h1 class="page-title">What is your interest in IT?</h1>
            
            <p> My interest in IT is programming and exploring things that I’m unable to do at this very moment such as creating complex robots. I would like to learn to code in RMIT; although I have minimal experience and background in coding, I feel like its an important aspect in IT that everyone should be able to explore and solve problems through. I am also interested in developing new apps and just seeing how they work and satisfy the needs of a user through not only effective but efficient and user-friendly product/service.</p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h1>
            <p>My interest in IT began from a significantly young age as my family in India got a desktop when I was 6 years old. But I only learned the basics and how to operate the computer in 7 years. Until I came to Australia and did Informatics as a subject in my two years of VCE. My teacher was extremely supportive and the content we learnt in those two years were crucial in sparking an interest in me towards IT. They also played a huge role in my decision of choosing IT as a career. </p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">Outline your IT experience (if any).</h1>
            <p>The only IT experience that I possess is from two years of Informatics in VCE. In year 11 we learnt the basic programming language and basic IT key terms such as qualitative and quantitative data as well as all the data types such as integer, Boolean, char, etc. Further, we learnt about RDBMS and techniques to collect data such as survey and at the end of year 12, we presented all the data we collected as a form of website which we developed using the Dreamweaver software. </p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
            <p>I chose RMIT for my further studies mainly because it was recommended by few of our family friends who studied IT in RMIT. It also maintains a high reputation for quality education in fields such as IT and engineering. I was also able to meet the entry requirements set by the university in my year 12 VCE and I’ve been wanting to study IT for past two years. So, I chose RMIT and to my fortune, I got selected by the university to conduct my higher education studies in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at the RMIT city campus.</p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1>
            <p>I expect to learn complex programming languages and develop each student to be IT industry-ready as soon as they graduate. I am expecting broad general IT concepts to be taught in this course and cover all the components such as hardware, software and design. I am hoping that RMIT will give each student internship and give each individual a head start in their IT career after graduation.</p>
