            <h1 class="page-title">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h1>
            <p>Overall, all the results attempt to sum up your personality, work ethic, learning style and how you behave around others. These tests are crucial if the job requires employees to work in groups for most tasks. The Myers-Briggs test suggests that I am an energetic outgoing individual with a positive vision and compassionate attitude towards others. The learning style test showcases that I am a mix of an auditory and visual learner, who learns by listening or looking at things. And lastly, big five personality test represents my behaviour to other people and general interaction with life. It comments on how open, outgoing and accepting I am towards other people and how determined I am to attain my goals and how I navigate my feelings and emotions to tackle distress in life.</p>
            
            <h1 class="page-title">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h1>
            <p>These results might affect the way I behave in a team. It's highly likely that Iâ€™ll be communicating a lot with my team members and not just act timid and keep everything to myself. I will be more accepting and discuss every team members idea before making a major decision in a group to avoid conjectures.</p>

            <h1 class="page-title">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
            <p>I can take these test into account when forming a team by making sure that I am working with people who are outgoing and easy to talk to as well as learn in the same manner as I do. This will ensure that everyone enjoys the work and being productive to fulfil tasks as a team.</p>
