					<h3>What is my IT Interest?</h3>
					<p>I am quite interested in Mobile Application Development as well as the development of new technologies in mobile and the wearable sector. My interest in IT started when I was young; around the age of 7 when I got my hands on a computer for the first time. I was immediately intrigued by the many different applications and uses for computers and as new technologies emerged I grew even more interested in IT and how computers would change and evolve over time. As a result of this interest I made sure to do as many IT subjects in High School as possible, learning how to code in Python along the way.</p>
					<p>I choose to come to RMIT because of the University's reputation and industry recognition in the IT Sector. My initial impression of the campus as well as the culture influenced my decision in choosing to study at RMIT. </p>
					<p>During my studies I expect to learn about how computers work; how they perform the operations they do and learn to program in various languages, how design a good program as well as learn how to create solutions that apply to real world scenarios.</p>

				<h2><center>Personal Profile</center></h2>
			<h3>Test Results:</h3>
			</header>
		<ul>
			<li>Myers-Briggs Test Results: Type INTP - T (Logician)</li>
			<li>Learning Style Test Results: Auditory/Tactile Learner</li>
			<li>Big Five Personality Test Results: Mostly 'Analytical Thinker' and 'Logical Mechanic' with a little 'Empathic Idealist'</li>
		</ul>

			<section>
			<h3>My Results & what they mean about me</h3>
			<p>My results in all three tests suggest that I have strong personality traits such as creativity and inventiveness as well as an auditory and hands on learning style. For example, my Myers Briggs result of INTP, to me, suggests that my thought process is unique and unceasing and I'm more interested in creative environments then day to day activities. Furthermore, my results from the learning style test, show that I'm a hands-on learner and someone who learns efficiently through listening. I find this to be accurate as I often learn best when observing or listening to someone explain something. Finally, my results from the Big Five Personality test, suggest that I'm a logical and analytical thinker but I do have a more idealistic, creative side that acts like a counter-balance to my personality. </p>
			<p>In a team environment, I believe that my creativeness and inventiveness would serve a unique yet important purpose, allowing me to think outside the box especially if I were trying to solve a particularly difficult problem. My logical and analytical personality traits as well as my auditory learning abilities would also be useful in a team environment as I would be able to not only work to find a solution to a problem but also hear and understand the proposals and solutions of other members of the team. </p>
			<p>When forming a team, it would be critical to find other team members had a good balance of creativity and logical and analytical thinking ability. This balance would help the team by making sure everybody both understood and could think outside the box when it comes to finding a solution for a problem. A team with such balance has the best chance of working well together when it comes to understanding the different ways in which team members could go about solving a problem. </p>

		<!-- Project Idea Report -->
			<section id="report">
			<header class="sectionHeading">
				<h2><center>Project Idea Report</center></h2>
			</header>
			
			<section>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>The Project will constitute a mobile application developed for iPhone/Android Smartphones, written in Java and Swift, that will provide real time, crowd sourced, peer to peer tutoring services from tutors in a user's immediate vicinity. The app will operate similar to services like Uber where GPS is used to locate and identify Tutors and then connect them with students. The app will streamline the locating of tutors as well as payment and make it easier for students to arrange place of meetings Users will be able to create an account and be able to build a profile to allow the system to connect them to the best tutors for their specific areas of study. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>The motivation behind pursuing this project is the real-world application of the technology to a long time traditional profession; tutoring. According to Victorian Government Statistics from 2017, there are over 400,000 secondary students in Victoria as well as over 1.4 million tertiary students in all of Australia, meaning that there is a huge demand for tutors across the country with a variety of expertise in all areas of study. Developing a mobile application that easily connects students to tutors is an efficient way of automating of an essential service used by the hundreds of thousands of students, as the vast majority of students own some kind of smartphone.  This project will be an interesting one to undertake as creating a platform to cater to the needs for a large number of students and thereby ensuring that enough tutors with different specializations are on the platform, will be a challenge especially when it comes to making sure the platform is a stable one and isn't plagued by geographic or informational errors. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The mobile application's features will be similar to applications such as Uber for example, where both student users and tutors will be able to make an account and profile for themselves and populate that account with information. In the case of Student users, the information requested will be personal information such as names, sex, year level/degree, etc; payment information such as credit card information or PayPal and subjects of interest. Tutors will also be required to provide personal information such as names and location and more importantly qualifications as well as payment information such as bank account details and PayPal account details. The system will locate available tutors in and around the area of the user in real time making use of Google Maps API and information provided by the tutors. Users will then have the option of requesting the tutor come to them or requesting an appointment time at a third-party location. The app will have notifications of the tutor's real time location and status once a student requests the tutor and student users will be able to track tutors real time location on a map.  Payment of a tutor specified fee will be made automatically between the student account and tutor account once the tutor formally finishes a session on the application. A review system in the application will be made available for students to give feedback to the tutors they hire. The user interface will involve three main UIs; a log in screen, the main map/location screen and a profile screen where all user information is displayed and can be edited. The UI will follow Google Design Principles and be adaptable for iPhone. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
			<p>The software & hardware needed for the system includes an iPhone and Android coding IDE in Swift and Java, as the program would have to be adapted to both operating systems to cater to users of both types of devices, thereby enlarging the possible demographics of the reach of the system. The Google Maps API would also need to be used to implement real time location tracking of tutor location. A cloud or physical offsite server will need to be set up to accommodate and store all user data including all names, study data, payment information, etc. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Skills Required</h3>
			<p>The skills required for this project include detailed knowledge and understanding of Java and Swift programming as well as Android and iPhone specific design and implementation skills. Ensuring that the system is developed in a way that acknowledges and takes advantage of the hardware and software differences in IOS and Android will also be required in development. Knowledge of the Google Maps API is also a must due to the system heavy reliance on real-time location tracking using Google Maps. Furthermore, knowledge of server infrastructure will also be required to set up and maintain the data server used to store all user information. </p>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Outcome</h3>
			<p>If the project is successful, millions of students across the country will have the ability to seamlessly connect with the tutor that best serves there needs. Furthermore, the success of this project could see the exponential growth in demand and use of tutors. The original idea behind this project was to create a system that would streamline and simplify the process of finding and hiring a tutor for students using technology that's readily available for the vast majority of students. If this project is successful, the mundane and often lengthy task of finding the right tutor would be solved.</p>
